# DataAnalysisPython
Project for the online course [Data Analysis with Python](https://jovian.com/learn/data-analysis-with-python-zero-to-pandas) at [Jovian](https://jovian.com). It can be run on Google Colab or Kaggle. 

In this project, I do the following.
- Download and clean a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/human-trafficking-victims-dataset-ctdc)
- Identify the origins and destinations of human trafficking
- Obtain summary statistics of the victims' profile and ways of exploitation
- Take note of the different trafficking process and the ype of exploitation for different socio-demographic groups

I use the following Python package to facilitate my analysis.
- `os`: to save data and keep track of results
- `Numpy`, `Pandas`: to clean and summarize the data
- `Matplotlib`, `Plotly`, and `Seaborn`: to visualize the data

Here is a brief preview of the findings.
- There is large variation in victims in terms of age and gender.
- The United States, Ukraine, Mexico, and Philippines are countries of large outflow. Russia, the United States, and Philippines are countries of large inflow.
- Female victims were more likely to be recruited by an intimate partner, and suffer from sex exploitation, regardless of their age. Male victims were more likely to be recruited by friend, and suffer from forced labor.
- A victim could be controlled by many means.
